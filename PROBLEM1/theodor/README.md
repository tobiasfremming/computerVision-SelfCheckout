## Case introduction

> Modernize the self checkout experience with computer vision

### Background

**Imagine a world** where checking out groceries is seamless, accurate, and fraud-free. At Meny Skøyen, we're building the foundation for this future with 8 cameras installed above self-checkout machines, creating a comprehensive dataset that pairs product images with their exact product numbers.

Self-checkout technology represents a **double-edged sword** for modern retail:

**The Opportunity:** Enhanced customer convenience, operational efficiency, and reduced labor costs.

**The Challenge:** **Substantial financial losses** due to fraud and errors. The situation is so severe that some international retailers have already begun removing these systems, with Norwegian merchants considering similar actions.

**The Stakes Are High:**

- NorgesGruppen operates **over 2,000 self-checkout terminals across 446 stores**
- MENY and SPAR estimate annual losses between **60 and several hundred million NOK**
- Approximately **0.5-1% of all items** pass through these systems without payment
- KIWI has deliberately limited self-checkout deployment due to these concerns

Beyond financial losses, many customers struggle with these systems, especially with **barcode-free items** like produce and bakery goods. This creates a frustrating experience and leads to both unintentional undercharging and overcharging.

To tackle these challenges head-on, MENY Skøyen has partnered with NorgesGruppen's AI lab in an innovative initiative. **All eight self-checkout stations** are now equipped with Logitech C920e cameras. The scale is impressive: approximately **11,000 daily transactions** involving more than **8,000 unique products** that need accurate identification.

**This is where you come in.** This INFORMATIONathon challenges you to leverage cutting-edge computer vision technology to revolutionize self-checkout, improving accuracy while creating a customer experience that's second to none.

## Challenge Overview

This INFORMATIONathon consists of two main problems:

1. **[Product Recognition (Problem 1)](./INFORMATION/Problem%201/description.md)** - Build a computer vision model that can accurately identify grocery products from images
2. **[Receipt Generation from Video (Problem 2)](./INFORMATION/Problem%202/description.md)** - Create a system that can produce an accurate receipt by analyzing checkout video footage
